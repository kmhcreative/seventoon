Manga+Press integration with the SevenToon theme is *experimental* and incomplete!

Jess Green only supports Manga+Press with the child themes available at:
https://manga-press.com/themes/

Consequently, do not expect any support from Jess if you are using SevenToon.

To use Manga+Press with SevenToon you will need to create pages for:

* Latest Comic
* Comic Archive

Under SETTINGS -> Manga+Press Options:

Latest Comic Page --> point to the page you created for that
[X] Group Comics
Comic Archive Page --> point it to the page you created for that
Comic Archive Page Style = Gallery
Archive Page Comic Order = ASC
Archive Page Comic Order By = Order By Date

SAVE CHANGES

Under Navigation Options:
Navigation CSS = Default CSS (unless you are customizing it yourself)

Manga+Press Comic Posts have the SERIES they belong to listed below them.
These are links to SERIES ARCHIVE PAGES that use SevenToon's Vertical Reading Mode

DATE ARCHIVES DO NOT USE THE SERIES ARCHIVE TEMPLATE.

Note that Manga+Press redirects regular blog posts to use the /comics/single-comic.php template.
